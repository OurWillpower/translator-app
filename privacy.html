        <h1>Privacy Policy for Speakly</h1>
        <p>Last updated: November 20, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Speakly ("the Service") is a free, simple translation utility designed for personal use. This policy informs you regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection Policy (Zero Data)</h2>
        <p>The Service is designed to function entirely on the user's device (client-side) and uses a third-party API for translation. **Speakly does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII), usage metrics, location data, or conversation history.**</p>
        <p>All input and translation processing occur only during the active use of the app and are not logged or stored by Speakly or WillPro Technologies.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Service relies on Google's translation API for the core translation function. This communication is anonymous, and we have no control over data collected by third-party services.</p>

        <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px;">**Contact Us:** For any questions about this Privacy Policy, please refer to our Terms of Service contact information.</p>
